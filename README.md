Parliament browser app for the Cross-Platform course.

Fork this repository and implement the new functionality.

To run:

2) Start the app: ```npx expo start```

Added functionality:
- A menu/intro screen with:
    - A picture
    - A menu where you can select:
        * Persons
        * Roles
- The Persons menu take you to the existing Persons list
- The Roles menu take you to a screen with a list of roles in the Parliament.

Did not get the rest of the functionality to work.
